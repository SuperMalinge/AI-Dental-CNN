# Dental Radiograph Analysis CNN

A sophisticated deep learning model for automated dental radiograph analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks. This model excels at cavity detection, root canal analysis, and dental structure segmentation.

## Features

- Cavity detection and segmentation
- Root canal structure analysis
- Dental anatomy mapping
- High-resolution image processing (1024x1024)
- Edge enhancement for dental structures
- Real-time visualization of findings
- Support for common dental imaging formats

## Clinical Applications

- Early cavity detection
- Root canal treatment planning
- Dental structure analysis
- Abnormality identification
- Treatment monitoring
- Clinical decision support

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- pydicom (for DICOM processing)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dental-analysis.git
cd dental-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
